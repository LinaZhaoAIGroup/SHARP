SHARP is an end-to-end backprojection reconstruction network model designed for synchrotron radiation CT.
You can train and test SHARP using the main.ipynb file.

For model testing, we provide test data and pre-trained model parameters for both bamboo and the leg claw region of mantis shrimp.
You can download the prepared test data and model parameters through the following link:
